# Given the following code...
#
# x = "hi there"
# my_hash = {x: "some value"}
# my_hash2 = {x => "some value"}
# What's the difference between the two hashes that were created?
#
# My Answer:
#
# In my_hash x: is a key whose value is "some value".
#
# In my_hash2 x is a variable equal to "hi there".  "hi there" is the key whose
# value is "some value".
